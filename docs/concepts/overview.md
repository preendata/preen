You get data from a [source.md](source.md "mention").

You shape the result set you want to retrieve from a Source with a [models.md](models.md "mention")

We resolve type discrepancies from Source result set with our [validation.md](validation.md "mention") step.

You can interact with your data through our interface or by digging directly into the [Broken link](broken-reference "mention")
