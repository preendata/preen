# Source

A **Source** is any data storage system that is listed under the [integrations](../documentation/integrations/ "mention") section, such as an RDBMS (e.g. Postgres, MySQL etc.), a NoSQL system (e.g. MongoDB) or file store (local disk, S3 etc.).



To register a **Source** with Hypha, you must provide connection information or credentials depending on the storage system. Detailed information on how to connect **Sources** can be found under the [config](../documentation/config/ "mention")and [integrations](../documentation/integrations/ "mention") articles.
