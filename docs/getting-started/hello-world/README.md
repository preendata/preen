# Hello World

Getting start with Preen is as simple as connecting to the data sources you want to query, defining your model, and querying the result.

The following pages provide a quick, low detail setup guide for those looking to get up and running on their own data ASAP.

You can see how to configure Preen in the [Example repository](https://github.com/preendata/preen-template). You can also use this repository as a template for creating your first Preen project.
